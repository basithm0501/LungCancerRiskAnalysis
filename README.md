# Lung Cancer Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to develop a model for detecting the risk of lung cancer using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide an early warning system that can help in the timely diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Risk prediction

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LungCancerRiskAnalysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd LungCancerRiskAnalysis
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
4. Make predictions:
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```
